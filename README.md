🚀 Project Overview  
This system enhances security by providing password-protected door access. Users can input a predefined password using a keypad, and upon verification, the servo motor unlocks the door. If the wrong password is entered multiple times, an alert system (buzzer and LED) activates to indicate unauthorized access.
